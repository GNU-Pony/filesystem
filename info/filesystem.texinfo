@chapter Overview

@command{filesystem} is a system base package that provides a implementation
of a filesystem hierarchy by creating directories and symbolic directories,
as well as providing files required for a system run but is not owned by any
other package.

@command{filesystem} also specifies directory permissions and ownerships so
other packages can be agnostic and not implement this themself.

The filesystem hierarchy is based on the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard developed
by the Linux Foundation.

@node /
@chapter @file{/}

@file{/} is top-most directory, there is a parition mounted on it, and it
is a very you ultimately find everything, even other paritions.

@file{/} is called ``root'', which may cause confusion is try to call it
@file{/} when possible or even ``slash'' if things get really confusing.



@node lost+found
@chapter @file{lost+found}

@file{lost+found} (`''lost and found'') is a directory create by most
filesystems, and you may find one at any mount point@footnote{A directory
onto which a file system is mounted}, including @file{/lost+found},
@file{/mnt/lost+found} and @file{/media/*/lost+found}.

When a filesystem finds an orphaned inode, that is, a file without any
known file names, it may put it in its @file{lost+found}

If you do not which to this file in your removable devices, you can
normally, depending on your file manager, add a file named @file{.hidden}
(the perfix dot means that it will be hidden) containing a line
with the text @code{lost+found}, in the device's mount point.



@node /mnt
@chapter @file{/mnt}

@file{/mnt} (``mount'') is a directory that is just there for your convience,
it is intended to be used as a mount point for a file system, normally
a removable device, that you are working with temporarly, and is not intended
to be mounted long term.



@node /media
@chapter @file{/media}

@file{/media} (``media'') as a superdirectory of long term mount points,
more specifically, it is intended to only contain directories that are
used as mount points for long term mounted filesystems that is not
incorporated into the remaining part of the filesystem hierarchy.

For example, if you have an external drive named ``oggcasts'', you
can create the directory @file{/media/oggcasts}, onto which you mount
the partion you have on the ``oggcast'' drive.

It is also intended for use of optical storage, floppy drives, zip
drived and alike, if you are still using any of those.



@node /root
@chapter @file{/root}

@file{/root} (``root'' or ``slash root'') is the home directory for the
system administrator, the user @code{root}. Normally there is no much
point to have a home directory for the system administrator as that is
not any user intended for use beyond administrations. However, it will
contian application configurations if the user chooses to have any, and
can also be used to store files needed for administration, that you
do not want to be clutter up your non-root user home directory.

Theoretically it is possile to symlink @file{/root} to your user home
directory so you do not need to separately configure the root user.
This paractice is however unrecommended, as messing up your user could
potentially mess up the root user as well; rather, you should keep
your root configurations as safe and minimalisic as possible.



@node /home
@chapter @file{/home}

@file{/home} (``home'' or ``slash home'') is the default superdirectory
for non-root user home directories. When you create a new user, if not
otherwise specified, the new user, named @code{zyzzx}, will be created
a the directory @file{/home/zyzzx} which will be set to @code{zyzzx}'s
home directory and only @code{zyzzx} and root will have access to it.



@node /info
@chapter @file{/info}

@file{/info} (``info'' or ``information'') is a GNU/Pony extension to
the filesystem hierarchy inspired by the filesystem hierarchy found at
the Royal Insitute of Technology.

By default only root have write access to @file{/info}, but you may want
to change the group to @code{faculty} (or similarily) and give write
access to the group.

@file{/info} is intended for privileged users to publish files, and is
thus fairly unneccessary for single user computers unless you give your
friends SFTP access.



@node /share
@chapter @file{/share}

@file{/share} (``sharing is magic'')@footnote{Or ``slash share'' or just
``share''} is a GNU/Pony extension to the filesystem hierarchy. It is intended
for user shared files. While users are recommended to create a directory
@file{~/Public} and give everypony read access to it, and store personal
non-private files in it for other ponies to read or canabalise, @file{/share}
is intended for all users to use together for non-personal data, for example,
you can put your radio shows, music, books or whatever, there.
